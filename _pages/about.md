I am a second year computer science Ph.D. student in [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu) advised by Prof. [Xiao Wang](https://wangxiao1254.github.io). My research interests mainly focus on security and privacy. I am working on oblivious transfer, multi-party computation, and zero-knowledge proof.


I got my Bachelor degree and Master degree in Xidian University in 2018 and 2021. During my master studies, I was advised by Prof. Jin Cao in authentication.
