I am a third-year computer science Ph.D. student at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu) advised by Prof. [Xiao Wang](https://wangxiao1254.github.io). My research interests mainly focus on MPC in practice. I am working on private set intersection (PSI).

#I got my Bachelor's degree and Master's degree at Xidian University in 2018 and 2021. During my master's studies, I was advised by Prof. Jin Cao on network security, specifically authentication in 5G.
