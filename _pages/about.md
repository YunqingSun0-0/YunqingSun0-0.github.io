I am a first year computer science Ph.D. student in [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu) advised by Prof. [Xiao Wang](https://wangxiao1254.github.io). During my Ph.D. study, I mainly focus on Cryptography, especially the secure multi-party computation.


I got my Bachelor degree and Master degree in Xidian University in 2018 and 2021. During my master studies, I was advised by Prof. Jin Cao in 5G authentication.
