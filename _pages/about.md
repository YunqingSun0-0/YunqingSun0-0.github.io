I am a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science department,[Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu) advised by Prof. [Xiao Wang](https://wangxiao1254.github.io). I mainly focus on the secure multi-party computation.


I got my Bachelor degree and Master degree in Xidian University in 2018 and 2021. During my master studies, I was advised by Prof. Jin Cao for 5G authentication mechanisms.
